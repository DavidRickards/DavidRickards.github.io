##Why A Bank?

This project was made for my 212 project 1 to create a bank interface that will allow users 
to add, remove and modify the account information of bank customer. It keeps a seperate list 
file that save all records in the database before closing the interface allowing it to be 
accessed again upon startup. The code was written in C and was run on UHUnix systems. I would 
have to stay the hardest part of this project was insureing that the text document with all 
the account information was read and written to and from teh text file correctly. Another 
difficulty was making sure the string were being read and correctly and discarded any excess 
character to avoid them spilling over into the next string inputed section.
