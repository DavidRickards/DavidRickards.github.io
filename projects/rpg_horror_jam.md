Untitled was the name of the 2D pixel RPG horror game that was designed and developed by the UHM Game Dev Club for a horror jam game. We started on the game during the early first few weeks of the fall semester 2022. It was my first time working with unity and I was assigned to create a functional main menu and connect it to the start of the game. The game was finished by early October. The game is available for play somewhere on [itch.io](https://itch.io/games).
