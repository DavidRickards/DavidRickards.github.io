 <p>The Planning Division of The County of Kauai created a poll a few months before my internship to gain feedback on some of their possible adaptations to climate change on the island of Kauai. The problem was that they needed more people to take their poll so what they did was they gave me information that they wanted people to know and then asked me to create a flyer for them so I did. The poll flyer is the purple one. The second flyer was to spread the word of an art contest to engage the youth into climate change. The flyer was also used to help advertise the youth submitted that we had begun to plan during my internship.</p>

<p>When I was originally assigned this task I assumed it would be quick and easy. I learned a few things from doing this. The first is that I learned about the site canva which is what many people use for graphic flyers, posters, and more. The second thing I learned was how to select the information. Flyers only have so much space on them so what is put on them needs to count. There also needs to be an awareness of what is emphasized and draws people in. In the end they were satisfied with the design and I was surprised with what I learned from it.</p>
