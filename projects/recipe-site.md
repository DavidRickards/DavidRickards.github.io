# Recipes For All The Students

For my final project in software engineering 4 other students and I built a website called “[Yummy Foo](http://146.190.161.129/signin).” Our goal for this project was to create a site where students are able to find, share, and learn new and creative recipes that will fit within the budget of a college student. For convenience and money’s sake or dietary constraints, the majority of students will buy fast food or take out for their meals. This leads to unhealthy eating habits and so to remedy this, our website will prompt UH students to begin or expand on their culinary knowledge. On our site, students can browse through the database recipes, as well as add their own, and favorite ones they want to try out. 

I learned a lot from projects such as how helpful [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) can really be. One of my tasks on the project was to create the favorite button on a recipe. To start with I was working with my own understanding and for a while that worked. It wasn't till I was trying to get the favorites to be unique to a single user and only one user could favorite a recipe did I get stuck. I tried a few different things but eventually caved in and asked ChatGPT. It was able to partially help me and explain the reasoning behind it. It was at this point that I started to use ChatGPT when I did not know what to do. I eventually understood that I had to use something other than a collection and ended up changing it to an array to store the user’s favorite recipes in. While writing tests for the favorites page I learned that even though something is seen on a page does not mean it is on the page. What I mean by this is that every time I tried to count the number of recipes shown on the favorites page it always turned out to be 0 and this is because it was being fed through. The collection was being displayed on the search page. I need to think outside of what I thought I knew because in the end I didn’t know.
