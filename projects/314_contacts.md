# First Contact

I made this contact  site in software engineering. The project was built upon previous assignments, culminating in the development of a site designed to manage and organize contacts. The objective of this site is to serve as a place for users to maintain their contact information effortlessly. Users have the flexibility to add or remove contacts at will, tailoring the collection to their specific needs. Additionally, a notable feature is the ability to attach personalized notes to each contact, creating a comprehensive and customizable database.

Throughout the course of this project, I gained valuable insights into the intricacies of web development. I learned the steps to construct a simple website, understanding the connection between pages and functions. Rigorous testing became an integral part of my skill set, allowing me to verify the functionality of website pages and guarantee a reliable and user-friendly interface.
