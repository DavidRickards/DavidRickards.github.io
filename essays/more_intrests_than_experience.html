<p>Software engineering is a class that I have long since been excited to take. Software engineering encompasses a wide variety of things. Most often is the development and maintenance of software applications. In the past, I would have normally thought of  banking/writing/company systems and applications that are ancient but as I went through college I see just how different each software engineer can be from each other. Rather than the up-keeping of old stuff I see software engineers as problem solvers that try to write a new solution to a problem in code, and I feel that is a far better image in my head than before that builds greater excitement for me.</p>

<h1 id="interests-in-this-class">Interests In This Class</h1>

<p>Since this past spring when I was unfortunately unable to register for the software engineering class but my friend was able to, I have had a growing interest in the web development side. When I heard from them that we would be making our websites as portfolios to show our work on I thought that was crazy cool. Part of what intrigues so much in web development is really the CSS aspect (at least currently). It gives so much creativity on how your web pages can be designed. While working through the Introduction to HTML/CSS on Khan Academy to prepare for this class, they showed something super interesting. It was a site that held a collection of that same page with the same info except they all look completely unique to each other!</p>

<h1 id="the-lived--learneds">The Lived &amp; Learned’s</h1>

<p>From this class I hope to learn all the necessary languages and applications to be able to function as a software engineer. A few weeks before summer started, I was asked by one of my father’s employers if I could make them a website. You see they were thinking of starting a new side business of sorts but they didn’t have a strong online presence to be able to advertise to people and encourage them to come. So, it became a goal of mine to try and make this site over the summer! Unfortunately, I was unsure of how to navigate this and then became busy. What I want to ensure I can learn is how I can navigate this (which include the languages and applications) and be able to create and present this site to him with satisfactory results and a new project outside of school that I would be able to present on my new professional looking portfolio that continue to use and add to.</p>
