<p>At first glance, the complexity of UI frameworks can seem daunting. Developers often question the need for these frameworks when HTML and CSS seem perfectly capable of creating static web pages. However, the complexity arises from the versatility they offer. UI frameworks are designed to streamline the process of creating responsive, visually appealing, and interactive web interfaces.</p>

<h1 id="one-foot-ahead-at-all-times">One Foot Ahead At All Times</h1>
<p>One of the primary advantages of UI frameworks is efficiency. They provide pre-designed components, such as navigation bars, forms, and modals, that can be easily customized and reused across different web projects. This consistency in design and functionality not only accelerates development but also ensures a cohesive user experience. Imagine building a website from scratch each time you embark on a new project. The time spent on repetitive tasks could be better invested in solving more intricate challenges and refining user interactions. UI frameworks allow developers to stand on the shoulders of giants, leveraging the work of experts in design and usability. It also helps to simplify otherwise daunting tasks for new learners.</p>

<h1 id="all-in-the-framing-of-mind">All In The Framing Of Mind</h1>
<p>Having the chance to work with <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap 5</a>, I can attest to the immense benefits it offers. Bootstrap simplifies the creation of modern, responsive websites, allowing me to focus more on other tasks. I agree that it does add more complexity as when I first began I was more confused than with CSS because of the use of unfamiliar terms but once I understood how to navigate it not only was I saving time but I was saving sanity. Since I have the ability to add the style in my HTML file I am not clicking around from file to file but instead keeping my code well-organized. There are still many things that UI Frameworks canâ€™t do and you know what that is okay. They are just a tool if it does work for you can just go back to CSS but having that option of a shortcut is always a blessing.</p>

<p>Here are two sites that are more or less the same:
This one is made with Bootstrap 5

And this is made with plain CSS
