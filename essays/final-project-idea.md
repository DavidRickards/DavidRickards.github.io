# Overview

Students are always trying to find time to get together and work on projects and homeworks but students are busy and 
they have their different school schedules plus outside events. The proposed solution is a website where students can 
upload their class schedule so that their fellow group members know exactly when everyone can meet up to work on projects.

# Mockup Page Idea

Some of the pages of this website would include a landing page, user page, search page, groups and chat page. The landing 
page would consist of a brief description of the site and a login for the user. Home page  is where users can use a 
search bar to find other users, sending them a friend request, there are also options to view the user profile or calendar 
groups. The user profile page would hold all of the users information that include the things like the name, weekly 
schedule, your personal monthly calendar, event list bar, and friends list. The calendar group is where you can create, 
delete, and view the different group calendars made with your friends that show the overlapping schedules and open times 
to meet.

# Case Ideas

- New user goes to landing page, logs in , get to logged in home page, setup  profile
- Admin goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, edits site
- User goes to home page, searches for fellow students with a student code given to each user, and send requests
- Userâ€™s friend request is accepted and can then view the friend's user profile, but not schedule.
- User sends a viewing request, friend accepts viewing request, user can now view all of the friends schedule and events.
