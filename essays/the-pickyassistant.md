# Always Dramatic About The Small Stuff
I am someone who loves to organize my code and break it up into more manageable parts but 
even so ESLint can be a bit much. It is particular with the spacing and amount of new lines. 
It tends to feel like a helicopter parent watching your every move. It makes a red squiggly 
line saying you are wrong feels dramatic when it is over a space and can sometimes lead to 
unnecessary panic thinking that there is a serious problem.

# Employee Of The Year Where It Counts
Despite all of its dramatics ESLint is a great helper. It offers suggestions that help to 
shorten unnecessary long code which also teaches me about these shortcuts and how to write 
them. It also assists in the reduction of bugs by catching errors early on in development 
that prevents them from growing into bigger issues. They also make sure that even things 
that is written is used as not to forget anything behind.

# For The Broader Sense
