# Tools To Take Beyond the Web
Although the technological stack makes it seem like web application development is the main focus of this software engineering course, there is a deeper layer of fundamental software engineering topics covered. In order to show their wider applications across a variety of project contexts, this essay examines two major course topics: coding standards and agile project management.

# Agile Project Management On Non-Web Dev Projects
[Agile Project Management](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/definition/Agile-project-management) is an important aspect of software development, emphasizing iterative development, collaboration, and adaptability to change. One specific style that I was introduced to and used in this course is Issue Driven Project Management.
Agile Project Management revolves around flexibility, customer collaboration, and responding to change over rigid planning. Issue Driven Project Management, as a subset, emphasizes breaking down a project into discrete, manageable issues or tasks. This approach enables efficient collaboration, continuous integration, and a transparent workflow. Beyond web development, issue driven management principles are applicable to projects that exist outside of Software Engineering. 
A simple example would be of an art project. Instead of treating the process as one task and instead apply the principles of issue driven management to break it down into manageable artistic tasks. Each issue could represent a specific element of the illustration like characters,  backgrounds, colors, and more. Just as problems arise in programming, so do they in art and with an issue tracking system these problems can be separated into their own issues. With this method, you can zero in on solving a single creative problem at a time, leading to a more structured and effective workflow.

# Standards For Excellence Beyond Coding:
[Coding Standards](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/coding-standards-best-practices#:~:text=Coding%20standards%20are%20a%20set,efficient%20code%20with%20minimal%20errors.) are the bedrock of a disciplined and collaborative software development environment. In this course, the emphasis on adhering to coding standards has implications far beyond the scope of web application development. Coding standards provide a common set of guidelines and conventions that enhance code readability, maintainability, and promote consistency across projects. Beyond web applications, these standards are equally crucial in any software development endeavor. In a scientific computing project, for instance, adhering to coding standards ensures that complex algorithms are not only functional but also comprehensible to other researchers. Similarly, in embedded systems development, where resource constraints are paramount, coding standards play a pivotal role in optimizing code for performance and reliability. Though it would not be quite the same coding standards can be applied to non-coding projects because the coding standard is just a common guideline to keep everyone's work in the same readable format. One example of this is in my creative writing class we are all required to produce a writing portfolio of our work from this semester. In order for everyone's portfolio to be easily readable, my professor sent out an example portfolio on how to organize and format all our works. We then copy this and also format it to her specific text-font, size, and spacing. Thus, the principles learned in this class regarding coding standards serve as a universal guide for producing high-quality, sustainable code in diverse software engineering contexts.

# Navigating Software Engineering's Vast Horizons
In summary, this software engineering course has provided insights into concepts that reach beyond the realm of web application development. Agile Project Management, especially Issue Driven Project Management, offers a flexible and collaborative approach applicable to a wide array of projects. Additionally, the emphasis on coding standards equips us with guidelines for code readability and consistency across various software development endeavors that standards are a universal thing you will find yourself using and following in different projects. As I conclude this class, prepared with these invaluable skills, I find myself ready to navigate the field of software engineering and any other field, prepared for projects of any nature.
