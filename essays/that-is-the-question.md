## Ask Smarter Not Harder



## Asking For Failure

Not asking smart questions will just cause you as well as others trying to help you to waste their time. One such example on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30449320/string-replace-doesnt-work) is a question that is having problems with replacing backslashes. From the header, the question fails to be  a smart question as described by Raymond with a babble that a snippet of their code doesn't work. They continue by not naming what language or system that they are working on, stating nothing on the steps they have taken to solve the problem, and just providing a snippet of the code asking for a solution. The one thing they want or have been trying to get out of it. As a result of their poor questions others are left confused and must continue to ask follow up questions to understand what the actual problem is with some thinking that they just mixed up their backslashes. The question is even marked down indicating to others that no research effort was made, the question was unclear.
