<p>I am someone who loves to organize my code and break it up into more manageable parts but even so <a href="https://eslint.org/">ESLint</a> can be a bit much. It is particular with the spacing and number of new lines.  It tends to feel like a helicopter parent watching your every move. It makes a red squiggly line saying you are wrong feels dramatic when it is over a space and can sometimes lead to unnecessary panic thinking that there is a serious problem.</p>

<h1 id="employee-of-the-year-where-it-counts">Employee Of The Year Where It Counts</h1>

<p>Despite all of its dramatics ESLint is a great helper. It offers suggestions that help to shorten unnecessary long code which also teaches me about these shortcuts and how to write them. It also assists in the reduction of bugs by catching errors early on in development that prevents them from growing into bigger issues. They also make sure that even things that is written is used as not to forget anything behind.</p>

<h1 id="for-the-broader-sense">For The Broader Sense</h1>

<p>ESLint is great for everyone to use because if everyone is following the standard then everyoneâ€™s code will look similar to each other. This can cause the readability of code to be better than if they were all different. People can help others better when they have a better idea of what they are looking at. It helps to keep a sort of consistency across an ever changing landscape. Having said that, I do believe that it is not something that should remain stagnant and should allow for creative freedom to change when improvement arises.</p>
