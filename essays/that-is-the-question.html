<p>Picture this, or just remember, you are working on coding  for one of your homework assignments and you keep getting an error that you have spent hours reading, testing, trying to fix only to no avail. When you finally decide to ask for help you want it to be quick and in order for it to be quick there needs to be a clear communication of things and ask smart questions. A good example of this is on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20279484/how-to-access-the-correct-this-inside-a-callback">StackOverflow</a> where they about the proper way to access the correct “this” data in a call back. This question would make Raymond proud because they don’t babble in the title, they explain their provided code, and the specific problem they are having with their code. They continue by explaining another method they tried with the attached source code. They end with a question instead of just a blank cry for help. Since it was asked smartly, someone was able to give specific feedback explaining in different parts how  “this” works and can be accessed. The question was also rated highly.</p>

<h1 id="asking-for-failure">Asking For Failure</h1>

<p>Not asking smart questions will just cause you as well as others trying to help you to waste their time. One such example on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30449320/string-replace-doesnt-work">StackOverflow</a> is a question that is having problems with replacing backslashes. From the header, the question fails to be  a smart question as described by Raymond with a babble that a snippet of their code doesn’t work. They continue by not naming what language or system that they are working on, stating nothing on the steps they have taken to solve the problem, and just providing a snippet of the code asking for a solution. The one thing they want or have been trying to get out of it. As a result of their poor questions others are left confused and must continue to ask follow up questions to understand what the actual problem is with some thinking that they just mixed up their backslashes. The question is even marked down indicating to others that no research effort was made, the question was unclear.</p>
